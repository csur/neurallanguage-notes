# Neural language notes
Simple notes on papers about neural language learning from arxiv, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and some machine/deep learning from ICLR, ICML, NIPS. This note is inspired by [Denny Britz's notes](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes). There is also dataset for neural language research [[link](https://github.com/dykang/neurallanguage-data)].
